# city-size-web-scrape
My first foray into web scraping, this python program uses Beautiful Soup 4 to scrape the list of largest cities by population and turns it into a data set.
SCRAPES FROM PAGE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities#List

Controls:

"A" for list of largest cities by population, ordered from largest to smallest

"B" for additional criteria, numbered

0-(X) to search using extra criterion found in "B". The list of criteria is numbered, so type the corresponding number

"[CITY NAME]" to search for a city in the data set: this will also pull the first paragraph from the city's Wikipedia page
